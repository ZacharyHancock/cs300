What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  -The problenm I was solving in these projects was to load in a data field into a data structure, offering the users the ability to search, remove, and display the data based on menu choices. This program allows the user to easily enter data into a structure
  automatically sorting them allowing for easy access.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  -I approached the problem of choosing a data structure by evaluating the requirements of the program. I chose a BST because it can easily sort data through recursion as well an average runtime of O(logN) this gives a very quick and efficient search, delete, and
  print abilities to the users. Data structures and their different implementations are important because there isn't a one size fits all, different requirements will ask for different data structures that will have different ease of use for different functions 
  weighing the runtime and abilities of the data structure.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  -I overcame roadblocks in my work by going back through the material to see the capabilites of whatever data structure I was working in, as well as looking at class libraries for the respective classes that I'm dealing with. THis helped me understand the deeper
  abilities of their functions and capabilites, the deeper understanding allowed me to better implement my code.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  -This project has expanded my approach of designing software by putting more focus on runtime efficiencies and capability requirements of data structures. My later development, I will now have a greater ability to understand my requirements past just the basic 
  capability of the program I am designing and the future adaptability and efficiency of the program.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  -The project has evolved my way of writing a maintainable, readable, and adaptable program by putting more focus on constructing a thoughful program with futureproof functions. This courses focus on runtime efficiency and choosing appropiate data structures forces
  me to keep it slow and methodical approach to create a more readable and adpatble program for the future, putting thought into every implementation rather than just jamming code in that will achieve the function.
